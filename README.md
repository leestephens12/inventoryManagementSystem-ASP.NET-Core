# Lee-Stephens-Assignment1-COMP2084
My website is an inventory maanagment website for a mock company I created "Stephens Electronics". First off you can create new items with the item model controller to store items in a
database to make it easier while updating the inventory table. Within the inventory table you can grab items you have created and list the stock on them "In stock" and "Quantity".
Through the inventory table you can also list the store location so that users know where the item is in stock.
I have included custom layout desgins by chaning the color scheme to the website, the font (Google Fonts) as well as the table and button schemes with bootstrap.
Project is now updated so users can register and login in with their own email and passwords.
Only authorized users will have access to CRUD functionality on the website meanwhile customer accounts will only have viewing rights.
Additionally users will be able to use their google account to sign up as well.
